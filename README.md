> ### [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Vue3** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Vue3** community styleguides & best practices.
